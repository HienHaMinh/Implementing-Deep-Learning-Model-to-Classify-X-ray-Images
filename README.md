# Implementing-Deep-Learning-Model-to-Classify-X-ray-Images

This project involves the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for
classifying medical images into three categories: Pneumonia, Normal, and COVID-19. The
dataset is preprocessed and augmented to enhance model performance, and the model
is trained and evaluated using Tensorflow. This report details the methods and outcomes of
this classification task, providing insights into the model's training process, evaluation
metrics, and overall performance.
